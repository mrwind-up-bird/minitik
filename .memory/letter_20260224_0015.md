# Letter to Myself (Session Handoff)

**Date:** 2026-02-24

## 1. Executive Summary
* **Goal:** Implement all remaining tasks from the plan: Instagram URL fix, platform delete methods, admin check on queue stats.
* **Current Status:** Task 1 (Instagram fix) complete. Moving to Task 2 (platform delete methods).

## 2. The "Done" List (Context Anchor)
* Fixed Instagram adapter `callInstagramPublishApi()` in `src/domains/platforms/infrastructure/adapters/instagram-adapter.ts` — replaced raw `content.filePath` (S3 key) with presigned download URL via `getPresignedDownloadUrl()`
* Added `getPresignedDownloadUrl` import from s3-storage
* Added `filePath` null check before upload
* Build passes with zero errors

## 3. The "Pain" Log (CRITICAL)
* No major issues encountered this step. Straightforward one-line fix plus import.

## 4. Active Variable State
* Branch: `main`, last push at `919c0fd`
* Uncommitted changes: instagram-adapter.ts fix
* Build: passes
* Plan file: `.claude/plans/piped-yawning-ocean.md` updated with 3 tasks

## 5. Immediate Next Steps
1. [ ] Task 2 — Add `deletePost` to PlatformAdapter interface + implement in all 3 adapters + wire into rollback
2. [ ] Task 3 — Add admin check to queue stats endpoint
3. [ ] Commit all changes and push
