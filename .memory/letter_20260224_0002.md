# Letter to Myself (Session Handoff)

**Date:** 2026-02-24, ~10:05 AM

## 1. Executive Summary
* **Goal:** Building "minitik" — multi-platform TikTok/Instagram/YouTube content manager
* **Current Status:** 7 of 8 tasks complete. Only Task #8 (PWA & Mobile) in progress with jamie-okafor.

## 2. The "Done" List (Context Anchor)

### Wave 1 (team-lead):
* Task #1 — Database Foundation: Prisma schema, PostgreSQL/MongoDB/Redis connections, seed data

### Wave 2 (parallel — 4 agents):
* Task #2 — Auth (taylor-kim): NextAuth v4, PKCE OAuth, AES-256-GCM token encryption, account service, rate-limited API routes
* Task #3 — Platform Abstraction (alex-chen): PlatformAdapter interface, Redis sliding window rate limiter, circuit breaker (5 failures/60s), TikTok/Instagram/YouTube adapters, platform-service orchestration
* Task #4 — Content Management (jamie-okafor): S3 multipart chunked uploads (resumable), video processor stub, content library with search/filter/bulk, WebSocket upload events, drag-drop UI
* Task #5 — Job Scheduling (quinn-reyes): BullMQ 4 queues, DST-aware scheduling, deduplication, dead letter queue, monitoring metrics, job status UI with auto-polling

### Wave 3 (parallel — 3 agents):
* Task #6 — Publishing Engine (taylor-kim): Publishing orchestrator with Promise.all parallel execution, per-platform content optimizer (aspect ratio, caption length, hashtags), publishing tracker with Prisma CRUD, rollback within 5 min, SSE real-time status UI
* Task #7 — Analytics Dashboard (quinn-reyes): MongoDB time-series with upsert, 4 parallel aggregation pipelines, Redis cache (5-min TTL), time-series gap fill + rolling average + growth rates, S3 CSV/JSON export with presigned URLs, refresh rate limiting (1/hr), dashboard UI with stat cards + bar chart + platform breakdown

### In Progress:
* Task #8 — PWA & Mobile (jamie-okafor): Service worker, push notifications, IndexedDB offline drafts, background sync, mobile nav, offline indicator

## 3. The "Pain" Log (CRITICAL)
* No new pain points in Wave 2/3 — all agents reported zero TypeScript errors
* Original Next.js init workaround still applies (created in /tmp, copied over)

## 4. Active Variable State
* Same as checkpoint 0001 — no .env file, .env.example has all vars
* All Prisma types generated and available
* 3 idle agents: taylor-kim, quinn-reyes, alex-chen

## 5. Immediate Next Steps
1. [ ] Wait for Task #8 (PWA — jamie-okafor) to complete
2. [ ] Run TypeScript build check (`npm run build`) to catch cross-file integration issues
3. [ ] Have alex-chen do integration review of all imports/types across domains
4. [ ] Wire up Next.js app routes to API route handlers
5. [ ] Shut down team agents
6. [ ] Save final checkpoint
